# Music Like You Mean It 2

Music Like You Mean It is a CMS and blog I created for an online music production training project I've been adding to off and on. It started as a Rails 6 app (archived [here](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Music-Like-You-Mean-It)) and has now been upgraded to take advantage of some of the improved tooling in Rails 7.

### Updates Since V1
* Better token code and abstraction
* New email provider
